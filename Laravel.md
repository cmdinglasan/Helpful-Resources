# Laravel Resources
These are my hand-picked go-to resources when I want to learn more about Laravel.

* [**Laravel's Official Documentation**](https://laravel.com): Of course, on top of the list is the official documentation of Laravel. Their documentation has been vastly improved to be easily understood by developers, mostly.
* [**Laravel Daily**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTuplgOBi6tJIlesIboymGA): Povilas made me want to learn more about Laravel. Laravel has been consistently growing and improving and his tutorials made me up-to-date with the latest and greatest features of Laravel. #PHPIsNotDead
* [**Andre Madarang**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtb40EQj2inp8zuaQlLx3iQ): Andre's series such as [Laravel E-commerce](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEhEHUEU3x5oPTli631ZX9cxl6cU_sDaR) and [TailwindCSS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEhEHUEU3x5p8cxOJ27w20LffCknp935L) help me in creating our school project. He teaches Vue.JS and Laravel in the most understandable way.
