# Resources List
This is a list of hand-picked resources that help me during my project development.

I will constantly update this when I find new helpful resources.

## Table of Contents

### Frameworks
May it be for front-end or back-end, these are the resources that help me to learn them.

* [**Laravel**](https://github.com/cmdinglasan/Helpful-Resources/blob/main/Laravel.md): A list of resources related to Laravel
* [**Vue.JS**](https://github.com/cmdinglasan/Helpful-Resources/blob/main/VueJS.md): A list of resources related to Vue.JS
* [**ReactJS**](https://github.com/cmdinglasan/Helpful-Resources/blob/main/ReactJS.md): A list of resources related to React
* [**TALL Stack**](https://github.com/cmdinglasan/Helpful-Resources/blob/main/TALL Stack.md): A list of resources related to the TALL Stack

### Tools
* [**PHPStorm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/): I used PHPStorm to code PHP-based projects. I think it is easier for PHP development because of its features such as auto-import of classes and auto-completion without any extensions.
* [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): I used Visual Studio Code for most of my project development because of its openness and also it is free.
